#### An open-source algorithmic trading platform written in Rust

## Intro

OpenAlgoTrader, or OAT, is designed to be an asynchronous platform for algorithmic trading, allowing users to employ multiple strategies at once. By following the Pub/Sub model of messaging, we're able to modularize different aspects of strategies and allow them to be reused by other strategies with very little increase in required computing power.

## Installation

OAT is written in Rust, meaning that it uses `cargo`. Building and running the project is extremely straightforward.


```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Usage

```Eventually there'll be some robust documentation here.```
